Well, 17-year-old Brandon “Taz” Niederauer is quickly becoming a guitar legend, preparing to add himself to the list of greats.&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CGDu2f4nynr/</p><p>Since making his debut on&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show at the age of 10-years-old, Niederauer has captivated the music world, appearing on additional shows such as&nbsp;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Good Morning America,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The View to showcase his amazing talent.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A true musical prodigy, Niederauer has gained the nickname “Taz” due to his ferocious guitar skills.</p><p>So just how did it all start for the young rising star? Well, at the age of eight, Niederauer watched the movie&nbsp;School of Rock,&nbsp;although already inspired by his father’s record collection, the movie took his interest in guitar from curious thought to reality.&nbsp;</p><p>At the age of twelve, this talented young man was cast as guitarist Zack Mooneyham in the Tony Award-nominated Andrew Lloyd Webber Broadway production,&nbsp;School of Rock the Musical.&nbsp;</p><p>Niederauer is unquestionably living the dream as he has had the opportunity to play with some of his music idols. The New York-based musician has shared the stage with the Allman Brothers Band, including Gregg Allman, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Butch Trucks, and Oteil Burbridge, as well as a variety of other notable musicians, including Buddy Guy, Stevie Nicks, Lady Gaga, Slash, Jon Batiste, Dweezil Zappa, Eric Gales, George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic, Dr. John, Gary Clark Jr., Col. Bruce Hampton, Eric Krasno, George Porter Jr., Robert Randolph, Karl Denson, Doug Wimbish, and John Popper. He has also performed with Tedeschi Trucks Band, The String Cheese Incident, Umphrey’s McGee, The Revivalists, Dumpstaphunk, Blackberry Smoke, Galactic, and many others.</p><p>Yet, the amazing life of Brandon “Taz” Niederauer doesn’t stop there. As recent as 2018, the teen reunited with Andrew Lloyd Webber, performing with Sarah Brightman at The Phantom of the Opera’s 30th Anniversary celebration, and after that with Sara Bareilles, Alice Cooper, and John Legend in the live NBC broadcast production of Jesus Christ Superstar.</p><p>Niederauer is currently featured in Spike Lee’s Netflix series, She’s Gotta Have It, and continues to perform concerts for audiences across the country and around the world. We have a feeling that this is just the beginning for this amazing young man and cannot wait to see what the future holds for him. With talent like his, he is unquestionably destined for greatness.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWlmamhfZYVwv8SvnKeslZq7bsXEmqlmp5yZeqO%2BwKebqKZdqa67ec2inJ2dopbCpr6MoqpmqaWesKy42GaZnpuforavs4yaZKCtmamus3nLnp6eppRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
