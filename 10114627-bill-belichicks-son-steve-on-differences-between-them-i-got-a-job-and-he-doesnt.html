He didn't have to wait long to find one as he joined Jedd Fisch's staff at Washington. Fisch, who had just successfully rebuilt the Arizona program, is in his first year as the Huskies' head coach.</p><p>He replaced Kalen DeBoer, who led Washington to a national championship game appearance before leaving for Alabama to succeed Nick Saban.</p><p>The new gig gives Belichick a chance to shine as a true defensive coordinator, as opposed to working under the auspices of his father, who was the de-facto leader of the defense.</p><p>As for Bill Belichick, he didn't land a head coaching gig this offseason despite interviewing twice for the Atlanta Falcons job, but he's been heavily rumored to potentially land a television gig. As noted by The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Andrew Marchand</a>, Belichick is being pursued by ESPN, but he does not have interest in being part of a regular studio show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmDc4OMm6ClpF2Xsq21wqGgnKOjYsCwuoysq56ulWK8r3nDop2fnaKau6Sx0maZnqynmrKvedOhnKZlmWK0sMCMmmSjp5Jirq%2BwjKGcZpyfmsCvwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
