We got big raises.”</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The union did not reveal the terms of the settlement, saying they need to be presented to the full union membership and ratified before taking effect. But it said it had been seeking “significant” raises to help employees keep pace with rising costs.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The settlements come at a crucial time for Atlantic City and its casino industry, which is striving to recover from losses caused by the pandemic and exacerbated by inflation and a labor shortage.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Yet those same factors were the driving force behind the union seeking a much larger raise than it had in past years; the exact amount has not been made public. In past contracts, the union concentrated on preserving health care and pension benefits, but this time sought what it termed “significant” raises for workers to help them keep pace with spiraling prices for gasoline, food, rent and other living expenses.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The deals avoided what would have been the city’s first casino strike since 2016, when the union rejected demands by billionaire Carl Icahn that the Trump Taj Mahal casino operate without health care and pension benefits that were terminated by a bankruptcy court.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The union went on strike on July 1, and the casino shut down on Oct. 10. It was sold months later to Hard Rock International, which gutted it and reopened it as the new Hard Rock Atlantic City in June 2018.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The finances underlying the current dispute are complex.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Including internet gambling and sports betting revenue, the casinos and their online partners have won $1.8 billion over the first five months of this year. That’s up more than 49% from the same period in 2019, before the coronavirus hit.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">But the casinos claim those figures are misleading because third-party partners keep about 70% of internet and sports betting revenue, leaving little for the brick-and-mortar casinos.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">They say a more accurate metric is money won from in-person gamblers. By that measure, the casinos have won only 5% more than they did from in-person gamblers over the first five months of 2019. Only three casinos — Borgata, Hard Rock and Ocean — have won more from in-person gamblers in that time frame.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">___</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC</p><p>Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.
