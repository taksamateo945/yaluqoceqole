Newlyweds’ <strong>Tina Sugandh</strong> and <strong>Tarz Ludwigsen</strong> tell <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> exclusively that they are expecting a baby girl together. The Bravo stars announced that they are gearing up for baby No. 2 during Watch What Happens Live on Tuesday, Mar. 3.</p><p>The Bollywood star is four months along, and has already picked out the baby girl’s name: <strong>Song Eleanor Sugandh</strong>. They chose the middle name in honor of Tarz’s mother, and the baby will keep Tina’s last name.</p><p>“I know, isn’t that terrible! But Song Sugandh, come on!” she told<strong> Us</strong>. “It sort of sounds like a stripper name.”</p><p>The couple came up with the name Song five years ago, and it was chosen for a special reason. “Song is in honor of my mom who passed away from breast cancer [in 2008]. It’s because my family, the Sugandh family, grew up performing music together since I was 5 years old,” Tina explained. “And my mom’s name is sort of the derivative of the word ‘Song’ anyway. Geeta means song.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Sugandh and Ludwigsen are already parents to son <strong>Tarz David</strong>, whom they <a href=#>welcomed in June 2013. </a>“He’s a little diva,” she gushed about her little one, who already has landed an H&M modeling job. She joked: “I’ve never had a professional modeling gig in my whole life. I’m jealous of my 1-year-old!” (The couple previously joked to <strong>Us</strong> that they would try for a third baby if the second was a boy again!)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The parents will have their hands full with two children, but Tina doesn’t plan on taking an enormous break. She’ll continue to help Tarz out with his start-up <a href=#>Pandoodle</a>, a computer vision company that specializes in advertising solutions. She also will keep busy with her belly jewelry line, <a href=#>Glitterbelly.com</a>, and continues to perform at private shows.</p><p>Tina has suffered multiple miscarriages before, but appears to be in good spirits in this pregnancy. She’s even not letting a little baby bump controversy bring her down. Two weeks after welcoming Tarz David, Tina showed off her skinny post-baby body on WWHL, leading critics to allege that she didn’t carry the baby herself. Her response now? In a new photo, she wrote “Real Enough, Haters?” on her bare baby bump.</p><p>“It was ridiculous,” she recalled, adding: “I am ginormous now!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKuippFirq%2BwjK2Yq7JdpLNurtGarairXaOyuLjYsJydq12nsrexwKVkm5mSrnqosc2dnKtlla29pq%2FToqWgZZeev615kWlobm9j</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
