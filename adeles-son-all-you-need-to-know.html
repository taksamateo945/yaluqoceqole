However, Adele has occasionally shared glimpses of her life as a mother on social media and in interviews.</p><p>In 2015, Adele revealed that Angelo was a big fan of her music, and that he particularly enjoyed listening to her hit song “Someone Like You.” She also shared that Angelo had a talent for singing, and that he often sang along with her when she practiced at home.</p><p>In a 2016 interview with Vanity Fair, Adele spoke about the challenges of balancing motherhood with her career. She explained that she had taken time off from music to focus on raising Angelo, and that she had struggled with guilt over being away from him while on tour.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Adele has made it clear that her son is her top priority. In her acceptance speech at the 2022 BRIT Awards, she dedicated her win to Konecki and Angelo, saying “I love you so much, kiddo. You’re the reason I do what I do.”</p><h2><span id=Parentage>Parentage</span></h2><p>Adele is the proud mother of one child, a son named Angelo Adkins. She gave birth to Angelo on October 19, 2012, with her then-partner, Simon Konecki.</p><p>Simon Konecki is a businessman who co-founded Life Water, a company that provides ethically sourced bottled water. He and Adele started dating in 2011 and were married in 2018.

I’m not going to do that to him.”</p><p>It is clear that Adele values her son’s privacy and will continue to do her best to keep him out of the public eye as much as possible.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>Adele is very involved with her son Angelo’s education.

However, Adele has been known to be very protective of her son’s privacy, so it is unlikely that any details about his school will be made public.</p><p>In a recent interview with Vogue, Adele shared that she has been homeschooling Angelo during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said that she has been “trying to be very careful” with her son’s education and has been “doing a lot of homeschooling”.</p><p>It is clear that Adele values education and is committed to ensuring that her son receives a quality education, whether it be through traditional schooling or homeschooling.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>https://people.com/music/adele-very-involved-son-angelo/</a></li><li>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>https://www.capitalfm.com/news/adele-son-angelo-adkins-age/</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>https://www.vogue.com/article/adele-cover-may-2021</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKG0rbvBmqOuqJSWwaa%2FjZympmeRmbKtsdJmqqimXZa5rXnYqKxmppWasW7Azmaip6enZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
