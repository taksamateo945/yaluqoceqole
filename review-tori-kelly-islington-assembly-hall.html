From a stream of singing competitions, label deals and closed doors she found herself in her bedroom – where many of her incredible early hits were made – with her guitar and a camera uploading covers to YouTube before being discovered by music mogul, Scooter Braun.</p><p>Arriving on stage, Tori Kelly, equipped with her guitar, signature curls and beaming smile stood sporting a pretty pastel pink playsuit in front of an interesting stage set up, consisting of an oversized leather sofa, free-standing living room lamp and a guitar stand.</p><p>From the initial moment she walked on stage it was clear that her extensive, yet appreciated, performance would be one exuding raw emotion in a humble, laid-back atmosphere. Kelly brought a unique melodic experience conveying her journey, highs and lows and her biggest hits encapsulated into a pitch perfect acoustic showcase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/review-tori-kellys-one-off-show-at-islington-assembly-hall-01-300x169.jpg><p>Kicking things off with her brand new track ‘Love Language’ and a powerful opening note, Kelly truly set the tone for the rest of the evening which oozed sultry, soulful and soaring high notes as she stripped back her biggest hits and poignant careers moments in a momentous medley.</p><p>Highlights of Kelly’s vocal masterclass also included beautifully crafted new material such as ‘coffee’, taken from her upcoming third studio album, throwback covers from her early career which electrified the room with a nostalgic warmth and roaring audience backing, and her big sing-a-long hits such as Ed Sheeran collaboration ‘I Was Made For Loving You’ and ‘Dear No One’.</p><p>With a two-hour set list and nothing more than an acoustic guitar, spotlights and an abundance of talent, Tori Kelly did what not many others in Pop could achieve keeping the audience engaged, emotionally invested and leaving us still somehow wanting more. What she lacks in theatrics and choreography, which her fellow chart competitors may possess, she more than makes up for in vocal talent, emotion and her ability to curate a truly memorable experience.</p><p>Overall an endearing showcase packed with tears, happiness and personality as she truly captured the hearts of the audience with her charm and determination. Tori Kelly brought her back catalogue to life through an impressive immersive story and stunned with her sheer talent proving she deserves a place at the top.</p><p>Tori Kelly’s brand new album ‘Inspired By True Events’ will be release this Friday across all major platforms.</p><p>Be sure to keep up to date with Tori Kelly on <a href=#>Facebook</a>, <a href=#>Twitter</a> and <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Let us know if &nbsp;you were at the show over on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kv6bCyJ6uZqyfp7Zut8Slo7Jlmai5qrrGraanZZGowKa5waWwZqCRoblw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
