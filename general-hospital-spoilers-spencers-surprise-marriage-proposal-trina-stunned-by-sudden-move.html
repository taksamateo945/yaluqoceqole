Even Esme told Spencer she can’t rely on him anymore because she had to rely on herself like any single mother has to do.</p><p>Spencer may not even know where Esme and Ace live-but his grandmother Laura Collins (Genie Francis) does and that’s what counts. She assured Spencer Esme is not going to take off for parts unknown with the baby, she has to keep her job at The Invader.</p><h3>GH Spoilers: Spencer Cassadine’s Not Thrilled About Not Seeing Baby Bro</h3><p><a href=#>Spencer isn’t thrilled about not seeing baby bro as much,</a> but he has finally realized that it’s for the best that he doesn’t co-parent him Esme because he’s not his parent!</p><p>Ace won’t feel abandoned by Spencer, he’s too young to remember this transition anyway, and he will get to see Ace whenever Laura and Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) do.</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali)" width=730 height=482 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/12/general-hospital-spoilers-spencers-surprise-marriage-proposal-trina-stunned-by-sudden-move/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital Spoilers: Spencer’s Surprise Marriage Proposal-Trina Stunned By Sudden Move?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GH-Spencer-and-Trina-2.jpg></p><p>However, Spencer does tend to be impulsive and rush into bold moves without thinking of the consequences, and his missing his baby bro might tempt him to fill that void.</p><p>He just might think about making his relationship with Trina permanent right away, possibly with making a baby of their own on his mind!</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers: Will She Say Yes, Or No, But Let’s Wait</h3><p><a href=#>It’s obvious Trina doesn’t want to lose Spencer,</a> and especially not forever-she was pretty upset with the prospect when he gave her that ultimatum regarding Ace.</p><p>But she may think it’s too soon to just rush into marriage too, she wants to finish her schooling first-although young marrieds have finished school, it’s not unheard of.</p><p>On the other hand, if she wants to wait for her mother’s approval that may never happen-although Trina will definitely be surprised and stunned by a sudden marriage proposal!</p><p>Trina may surprise Spencer by saying yes, but they’d have to find their own space to live-she won’t want to move in with Kevin and Laura! On the other hand, she might tell him not now, but eventually-after they get a few things settled like their own place to live.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with GH right now.
