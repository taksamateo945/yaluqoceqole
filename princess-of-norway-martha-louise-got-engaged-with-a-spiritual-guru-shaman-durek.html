On Tuesday, Louise and Durek announced the news on their Instagram profiles. Durek posted a photo of himself and Louise looking into each other’s eyes, with the caption:</p><p>“YES!” she said. You know when you know. There is nothing greater than knowing as a male that the lady in front of you is the one.”</p><p>He went on to write,</p><p>“I’m overcome with emotion at the prospect of spending the rest of my life with the most pure-hearted, angelic, smart, and powerful lady who, in my opinion, epitomizes all levels of divinity.” As a soulful spiritual pair, we will utilize our collective power to assist others in creating a world built on love and acceptance. “Through our love, we are changing the world.”</p><p>Princess Märtha Louise also announced on Instagram that she is engaged to Durek, who makes her heart skip a beat, recognizes her for her full potential, and makes her laugh. She also stated:</p><p>“Love transcends and grows us.” And I am very excited to continue growing with this wonderful guy.”</p><h2>Everything about Princess Märtha Louise’s fiancé</h2><p>Shaman Durek, born in 1974, is a self-proclaimed shaman and the author of Spirit Hacking: Shamanic Keys to Reclaim Your Personal Power, Transform Yourself, and Light Up the World.&nbsp;His mother is of Norwegian-Indian ancestry, while his father is Haitian. According to historian Marlene Koenig, his father’s ancestry may be traced back to Louisiana, Virginia, and Georgia in the past 200 years, but not to Haiti.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Martha-Louise-2.jpg alt="Märtha Louise" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He started off as a model and was briefly featured on television programs. According to Vanity Fair, he is bisexual, and his early actions helped catapult his style of new-age shamanism into celebrity circles since he grew up in that society.&nbsp;He has defined his shamanic teaching method as “no-nonsense.” He promises to demystify spirituality by making it accessible and clear to laypeople, spiritually mature people, and others.</p><p>Durek said that his aim is to bring the ancient practice of shamanism to the forefront of consciousness and to assist people in being lighted by nurturing love and acceptance of themselves and others. He claims to have been spiritually initiated by an American lady who calls herself Princess Susana von Radic of Croatia; however, several fact-checkers have found that she is a scam artist posing as a princess.</p><h2>Timeline of Princess Märtha Louise and Shaman Durek’s relationship</h2><p>In May 2019, Princess Märtha Louise announced her romance with Shaman Durek. However, Norwegians rejected the partnership, labeling Durek a fraud.&nbsp;Durek was also chastised in Norway, where the media referred to him as a conman. Durek and Louise have hosted controversial lectures such as The Princess and the Shaman.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Martha-Louise-3.jpg alt="Märtha Louise" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Previously, Durek was married to Zaneta Marzalkova.
