With Tully Blanchard barred from ringside, Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler would have to outwrestle Matt and Nick Jackson to retain their titles.</span></p><p><span>The commentary team put over Matt's injured leg and the guts it took just to compete. The Bucks neutralized Harwood's fist early, targeting the champion's right hand after he had struck it on the ring apron.</span></p><p><span>The champions worked over Matt's leg, looking to further exploit it. As the gutsy competitor fought back into the match, Wheeler distracted Nick, preventing the tag. Matt finally did make the tag, and Nick exploded into the match, popping the crowd and quickening the pace.</span></p><p><span>The champions momentarily halted the momentum, but a blind tag to Matt allowed the Bucks to catch Wheeler off guard with a spear for two. Matt tried to do too much, with his knee not allowing it. FTR delivered the Steiner Brothers' bulldog finisher, but Matt kicked out at two. At the same time, Nick speared Wheeler off the apron.</span></p><p><span>Back inside, the Bucks delivered a 3D to Wheeler and then followed with a Swanton as both teams pulled out the finishers of the teams that inspired them.</span></p><p><span>Harwood flattened Nick with a powerbomb, and Matt immediately rolled him up for two. Dax injured his hand by throwing a punch, allowing Matt to fire off a series of strikes. FTR looked to recover with a spike piledriver, but Nick sent Wheeler to the ground. Matt applied the Sharpshooter, Dax reached for the ropes and Nick superkicked the injured hand, forcing the heel to break his grasp on the rope.</span></p><p><span>Matt stomped on Harwood's hand, snapped his fingers and joined Nick for the BTE Trigger. Wheeler broke up the pin. Nick wiped him out at ringside with the escalera, while Matt teased using a chair on Harwood. Instead, he set up for the Indie Taker, but Wheeler appeared and powerbombed Nick into a table at ringside.</span></p><p><span>The spike piledriver followed, but Wheeler erred and Matt draped his foot over the bottom rope to break the pin. Ripping the boot off his injured foot, FTR worked over Matt's limb, looking to force a submission.</span></p><p><span>Wheeler attempted to wipe out Nick but whiffed, and the younger Buck delivered a 450 splash to Harwood for two.</span></p><p><span>Moments later, Matt seized a momentary opening presented by Cash's failure to pin after his own strike and blasted Wheeler with a superkick to earn the win and titles. Kenny Omega joined the victors after the match.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Young Bucks defeated FTR to win the AEW Tag Team Championship.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There's your AEW Match of the Year.</span></p><p><span>This lived up to the loftiest of expectations, providing fans a smartly wrestled match heavy on in-ring psychology and storytelling. Both teams dealt with injuries and borrowed from the arsenals of wrestling's greatest teams.</span></p><p><span>In the end, it was an uncharacteristic mistake by Wheeler, the second in a matter of moments, that cost FTR the victory.</span></p><p><span>There will be some who loved the finish, with Matt reverting to the thing that brought the Bucks to the dance, while others will consider it anticlimactic. Either way, more than enough preceded it to secure it consideration for the title of pro wrestling match of the year, especially given the heightened expectations that preceded it.</span></p><p><span>Just a great, great bit of business and the classic we had waited on from FTR since they arrived in the company in May.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXJpZm2Gd3nAnq5mnqWhuW6zxJqpZmpgZ31uvsSsrKWso2LEqrrNnqmsZZenrqWx0mapnpmTqbawuoyapZ1lmJ60qbjIoJ%2Btqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
