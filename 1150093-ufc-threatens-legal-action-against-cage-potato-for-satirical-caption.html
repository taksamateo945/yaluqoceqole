It’s an entertaining, very funny <a href=#>MMA</a> website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Their writers take stories from around the MMA world and apply a satirical, comical element to them. It’s a refreshing alternative from traditional reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Satire</a> also has a very rich tradition in society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s based on the assumption that a reasonable person will be able to recognize that what is being said isn’t necessarily “true,” but simply a statement intended to elicit a reaction, be it humor, or something more lofty, like a social or political statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, <a href=#>Dana White</a> isn’t a fan, and he’s gotten his lawyers involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The issue stems from a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caption</a> (since taken down) of a Cage Potato story that read, “Not only am I paying Bones to wear UFC logos on his walkout gear next weekend, I also placed a $500,000 bet that he’d beat Rashad. Oh sh*t, I guess I shouldn’t have said that out loud.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Suffice it to say Dana White was less than amused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A reasonable person, however, should be able to read that caption and immediately deduce that it’s just a joke. In that case, the UFC really has no legal leg to stand on, but that doesn’t mean White cannot make life miserable for the Break Media-owned website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Cage Potato issued a quick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">retraction</a>, and one of their writers, Jason Moles, sent a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> to Dana White with the link to the retraction, and asked if they were cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Cage Potato managing editor, Ben Goldstein spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a> about the issue, “This is just so silly that I want to print this retraction and get this behind us.”&nbsp;</p><p>Based on White’s tweet, and his already foul feelings for the site, this isn’t an issue that will&nbsp;likely be squashed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Goldstein wants to make it clear that he has no intentions of bowing down to White should the UFC boss wish to take further action.</p><p>“I have no problem swallowing my ego and apologizing for a joke,” he said. “But if it turns out they want to set their lawyers on us on a regular basis because of satirical captions we write on our website, then we’ll fight back.</p><p>"We’ll get our own lawyers involved and defend ourselves…We’re not going to change the way we do business.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the most powerful man in the sport, White has long been a target for ridicule, humor and satire. That pretty much comes with the territory. So what makes this particular episode so special? Well, White has a long running hatred for Cage Potato.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dana’s anger likely stems from another event that took place in October 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>UFC ring girl Arianny Celeste was featured in Playboy. Cage Potato went ahead and published the photos on their site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Goldstein got an impromptu phone call from a livid Dana White, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Goldstein</a>, said, “I’m going to (expletive) you up worse than you’ve ever been (expletive) before.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>CagePotato has since been banned from all Zuffa events, and with this latest incident, it’s&nbsp;a safe bet that the ban will stick forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGptYGWGdHnUn5pmrJinsqLAxKeqZqSVnK6tecCcq6KnnmKuqK3Ip6qtZZOWtKZ5z6irmqyfYrOwvoysmK2hop6woriMnJiprJmkuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
