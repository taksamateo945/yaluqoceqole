With this many Scorpios in one family, it should come as no surprise if tensions and difficulty arise when disagreements occur.&nbsp; However, this year it seemed the Scorpios have retracted their pincers and all is well. In fact, Kendall Jenner not only celebrated Halloween in style, but she celebrated her birthday as well. Even her brother Rob <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made public appearances</a> in honor of Kendall‚Äôs special day. None; however, took to social media to share how much Kendall means to them like her mother, Kris Jenner did.</p><p>Kris Jenner shared multiple throwback photos of Kendall on her special day that have since gone viral. Caitlyn didn‚Äôt post any photos of Kendall, but she did share some photos from her own birthday party that both Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner attended.</p><p>On Kylie‚Äôs birthday, Caitlyn had a bit of a snafu as she accidentally<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> uploaded photos</a> of Kendall instead of Kylie when she wished her daughter a happy 22nd birthday. Maybe Caitlyn is taking the safe approach when it comes to Kendall.</p><p>Kris Jenner wrote the following caption as she shared sweet photos of Kendall throughout the years.</p><p>‚ÄúHappy birthday to my beautiful angel girl @kendalljenner!!! You light up every room you walk into and everyone you meet and you light up my life every single day. You are so beautiful inside and out and I‚Äôm so proud of you Kenny!! You are the most amazing daughter, sister, friend, and I love you more than you can ever imagine. Have the best day, birthday girl!! You are my heart, ‚ù§Ô∏è Mommy #HappyBirthdayKendall üéÇ‚Äù</p><p>You may see the photos that Kris Jenner shared in honor of Kylie Jenner‚Äôs birthday below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4aDlMup5dM/</p><p>With Kendall‚Äôs birthday so close to Halloween, it appears that she has always celebrated both at the same time.</p><p>Here are some more photos that Kris shared showing Kendall wearing a tutu as a young girl and wearing the famous Giambattista Valli H&M tulle dress that turned heads at Cannes.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4agnOVpl7j/</p><p>Are you surprised that Caitlyn Jenner didn‚Äôt post anything on her social media accounts regarding Kendall‚Äôs birthday? Though she didn‚Äôt post anything publicly, Caitlyn and her partner Sophia Hutchins did attend Kendall‚Äôs party.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Kendall celebrating her birthday on Halloween?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebp7a0ecmepaedomKwprjEm6marJWoeqyxzZ2YpaRdn7KvusSrqmZqZKm1bq7Iq6uhnJGueri106Fkmpyfp66juMRmq6Gqn6yvoq%2FKZqehp6SkwG5%2FknBub25f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
