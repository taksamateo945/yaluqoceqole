Vina Rose’s debut single, “Breathe Again” is an unforgettable track that will certainly be memorable amongst all the new music that you listen to today.</p><p>Vina Rose has just started out on her music career but what a way to begin it with this addicting track! She’s from Sicily, Italy and recently moved to London to focus on a career in music, working in some of the best studios including Abbey Road. Not only that, but she’s also performed alongside the likes of Andrea Bocelli, Alexia and Giorgia; performed at a number of festivals; and, appeared in a few shows for the BBC and ITV. She’s certainly starting to make her name known and her first step in the music industry with “Breathe Again” is certainly one that deserves to make an impact.</p><p>According to Spotify, the song has been written by Galvin Holligan, Riccardo Mitchell, and Valentina Carmen Naselli (Vina Rose). It has a 90’s club classic feel to it mixed with current EDM with hints of 00’s R&B thanks to her beautiful voice. Talk about paving her own path in the music industry, Vina Rose is certainly one to watch as this is an incredible debut track so much so that it excites us for her future music releases.</p><p>Talking about the track, Vina Rose said: “I wanted to make a summer classic to see dance and pop fans through the coming months so I wrote dreamy vocals over an uplifting EDM backdrop. It’s a song about a spiritual and emotional rebirth, the desire to turn fears and indecisions into confidence and action. It was amazing working with Gavin Holligan from Hollerzz Productions and Geoff Pesche at Abbey Road Studios – the production sounds so clean & crisp! I can’t wait for my fans to hear the finished result!”</p><h3>Listen To Vina Rose’s Debut Single “Breathe Again” Here:</h3><p>“Breathe Again” is available to download and stream right now.
