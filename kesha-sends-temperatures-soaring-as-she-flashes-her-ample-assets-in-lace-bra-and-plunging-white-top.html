more about music deal making than ever before.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Part of the ongoing battle revolves around how much Kesha has been paid for her work as an artist, which has all been kept secret and will be made public soon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sony Music had argued that the release of details such as royalty rates, artist advances, producer fees and recording budgets would cause ‘substantial harm’ to the company.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They also argued that, in terms of their record contract with Kesha, if those details were to be made public, ‘Sony’s competitors would likely use it to encourage artists and producers to sign with other record companies, instead of Sony.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kesha’s attorneys at O’Melveny stated, ‘That is a stunning admission of the unreasonableness of Sony’s deal terms for Kesha’s albums.</p><img decoding=async id=i-89c14d94f2943abc

requiring Kesha––a Grammy-nominated artist who has generated enormous amounts of money for the label––to continue to work, but that is not a valid basis on which to keep the information confidential,’ the statement added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both Kesha and Dr. Luke’s teams have been preparing for the upcoming trial, with the O’Melveny team stating they plan on showing how her shoddy contract helped hide the ongoing abuse.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Dr. Luke is suing Kesha for breaching her contract with his production company, and Kesha will show at trial that the paltry deal terms and nearly a decade of never-actually-fulfilled promises to improve the contract is one of the manipulative tools that Dr. Luke used to coerce Kesha into keeping silent about his abuse,’ the statement read.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The judge is allowing Sony to redact personal identifying information and contact details for its employees, though the details about the contracts and financials will still come to light.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Any other asserted privacy interest Sony has in its records, many of which are quite old, is overwhelmingly outweighed by the public’s right to fully understand the parties’ contentions regarding the substantial damages sought by plaintiffs,’ Schechter said in her brief.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kesha initially sued Dr. Luke back in October 2014, claiming he sexually assaulted and harassed her over 10 years of working together.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr. Luke countersued over the rape charge while Kesha filed another countersuit that his claims of defamation have no merit and are subjected to a law intended to protect free speech from frivolous litigation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Schechter will soon start ruling over what evidence will be admissible in the trial.</p><img decoding=async id=i-43f4676719decc50
