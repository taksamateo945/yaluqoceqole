The season is long enough that everything usually evens out pretty quickly.</p><p>Sure, the Astros will have to adjust strategy by using an everyday DH, and they will obviously face different teams more often. But other than that, what else changes?</p><p>According to former Astros players, this move means a lot more than just baseball.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it's a travesty," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Lance Berkman</a>, who still considers himself as an Astro. "It's a National League franchise. I think if they were going to do something like that, Milwaukee's the choice to go back to the American League; they're historically an American League franchise."</p><p>And therein lies the real problem.</p><p>Ever since the Houston Colt .45s entered the league in 1962, this has been a National League franchise. Even though the changes to the actual game will be minimal, fans will have a tough time adjusting.</p><p>They don't want to watch American League baseball when they've only known NL baseball their whole lives.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a shame, I think, that Bud Selig is probably going to make that be sort of a condition of the sale," Berkman said. I don’t like it. Even when I retire and live here in Houston, I don’t want to go watch American League baseball. I’d like to have a National League team.”</p><p>Berkman wasn't the only one to think the <a href=#>Brewers</a> should be the team to move, either.</p><p>“The team that should be in the American League is Milwaukee,” said former All-Star outfielder Jim Wynn, who played for the Astros from 1963-1973. “Milwaukee came from the American League. The National League team is the Houston Astros. If they move to the American League, the fanbase is going to get really mad.”</p><p>Again, it all comes down to history. The Brewers are historically an AL team and therefore should be the team moving to that league.</p><p>But unfortunately for Astros fans, Jim Crane didn't buy the Brewers. This is his decision, and it is officially going to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Major League Baseball is a league with storied traditions. Now, with this move, one of those traditions is ending.</p><p>It won't change the game, but it's always hard to watch traditions die.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJocG1tYGyEbrTOrqqtp55irrTA0aiqZpmcYsSmv9NmpZ6vXaTEr7HRZqGipV2Yv6K6xGauoqScYrqwwsRmq6GdXamyormMraZmmZxitq95kWlobA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
