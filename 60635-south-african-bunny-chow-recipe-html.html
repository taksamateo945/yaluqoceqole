The recipe originates from the Indian community in Durban, South Africa. The curry is made of meat (mutton or chicken) and potatoes or sugar beans. Sometimes, when a quarter a loaf is used instead of full bread, it is referred to as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kota for 'quarter</a>.'</p><h2>Why is it called bunny chow?</h2><p class=align-left>The biggest question is why do they call it a bunny chow? The term bunny chow is an Indian slang in South Africa for Gujarati food. Surprisingly, the bunny does not stand for a rabbit. Instead, the common term comes from South African Indian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">slang word ‘bania</a>,’ which means Gujarati person.

One of the arguments traces back to the time of Indian migration into South Africa. The theory suggests that Indian workers at sugar plantations used to carry their vegetable curries in hollowed-out bread for convenience during transportation. The white bread, which replaced the traditional roti, was locally available and cheap. Another theory suggests that Indian ‘banians’ served the dish in their restaurants, hence the name, bunny chows. Yet, another theory suggests that the delicacy was introduced during the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apartheid era </a>when blacks were denied entry into restraints. The bread was a holder for the curry, which meant that blacks could only buy take away food.</p><h2>How much is a bunny chow?</h2><p class=align-left>The price of the curry bunny ranges from R15 (for quarter beans) to R50 (for quarter mutton).
