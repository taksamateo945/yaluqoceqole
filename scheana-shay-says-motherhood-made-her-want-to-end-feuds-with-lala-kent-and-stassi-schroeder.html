And it makes all of the petty, podcasts, Instagram Live bullsh–t, he-said-she-said stuff, just go out the window.”</p><p>She continued, “Like, that’s not important. It’s important having a support system and being able, for all of us, to get past all that other stuff and be friends again and support each other has been so helpful.”</p><p>But Shay’s <a href=#>fiancé Brock Davies</a> begged to differ.</p><p>“I’m not buying it,” he said to us, before telling her, “I hope you guys are friends again, but I think it was a bulls–t answer just then. I think it’s just because you prefer to get along with everybody and it’s good to have them around.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>Scheana Shay says her friendship with Lala Kent and Stassi Schroeder is back on amid motherhood.<span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Homebody co-founder added, “It’s a different dynamic this time around when you guys became friends again, because of different reasons. Because of kids.”</p><p>Shay agreed, saying, “Having the baby, that was the main thing that brought us all together.”</p><p>Davies chimed in, saying, “So it’s a different friendship. She’s done with the old petty one and I hope that’s the change.”</p><p>Shay <a href=#>reunited with her former foes</a> earlier this month for a post-motherhood rapprochement. Shay <a href=#>welcomed her first child</a>, daughter Summer Moon Honey, in April; Kent <a href=#>gave birth to daughter Ocean Kent</a> in March and Schroeder<a href=#> welcomed daughter Hartford Charlie Rose</a> in January.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=#></a>Shay reunited with fellow new moms Kent, Schroeder and Brittany Cartwright in September. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>But it wasn’t too long ago that Shay was ready to cut Kent and Shroeder out of her life for good, reaching a breaking point when neither woman was allegedly there for her when Shay <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage.</a></p><p>“I unfollowed [Lala]. I never see a friendship with her again. And I am completely fine with that,” she had said on the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;“#NoFilter with Zack Peter” podcast</a>&nbsp;last year, adding, &nbsp;“For the last three years, I felt myself forcing a friendship with her because every time she hurts me, she feels bad, she begs for my forgiveness — but, it’s usually when there’s a camera in her face — and I forgive her! And then she does it again.”</p><p>And on the topic of Schroeder, she stated, “I was like, ‘You know what Stassi, we’ve been surface-level for years. I’m fine continuing that way. I wish you nothing but the best.’ And I just went and unfollowed her because you know what, I don’t follow people that I’m not friends with.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno5i1pq3NmmSsoJGuerSt2KxkpqeknbKztM6om2alkZmybrTEq2SwmZ6perW7jJ6lnWWWmsKlv4ywoK2gXaGura2MpJynrF2Wu6V50q2YrKuZYsCktNGonJ2domQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
