After an excruciating, messy divorce and months spent trying to win his ex-wife <strong>Paula Patton</strong> back, he’s found himself a new leading lady.</p><p>The R&B singer, 38, stepped out at the Cannes Film Festival this week with his gorgeous girlfriend <strong>April Love Geary</strong>. The two were first spotted together last fall, but made their official debut appearance as a couple in the French Riviera.&nbsp;</p><p>Thicke walked arm in arm with his much younger love, a 20-year-old model, attending swanky events as a twosome at the festival. Thicke and Geary turned heads at the De Grisogono fête on Tuesday evening, continuing their party-hopping the next night at the star-studded Chopard-Annabel’s affair.</p><p>On Thursday, amongst famous faces such as <strong>Kendall Jenner, Michelle Rodriguez</strong>, and <strong>Marion Cotillard</strong>, Thicke and Geary cozied up to one another at the amfAR Gala. “They were super flirty all night,” an insider tells Us. “They spent much of the evening hanging out away from their table at the back of the room. They were very touchy-feely and clearly very into each other.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Thicke’s romantic week with his girlfriend comes just two months after his divorce from Patton, 39, was finalized. The parents to son <strong>Julian</strong>, 4, split in February 2014 after a <a href=#>cheating scandal on the singer’s part</a> and a bit of a <a href=#>fall from grace</a> for him in his career.&nbsp;</p><p>After the massive success of “Blurred Lines” and its subsequent dramas involving <strong><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Marvin Gaye</a></strong>, Thicke followed up with a seventh studio album dedicated to his childhood sweetheart. Paula was released in mid-2014, hoping to winning Patton back with tracks such as “You’re My Fantasy,” “Love Can Grow Back,” and “Forever Love.”</p><p>Thicke did not succeed in his attempt to romance Patton, but got to know Geary just a few months later. The California stunner celebrated Thicke’s 38th birthday with him in March, after previously being spotted out with the “Lost Without U” singer in late 2014 and early 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmompmjerW0yJyinmWXnr%2BtstGinKecXZa9s7XLZqOorpVitKat0bJkra2io3qpscCdqmaZpGKworrNnqpmamBmgnN%2BlA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
