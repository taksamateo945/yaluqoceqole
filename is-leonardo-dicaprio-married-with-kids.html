Hall has a special place in her heart for dogs which is evident on her social media pages.</p><h3><strong>Kristen Zang and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/1AKC_Pekingese_Dog_Show_2011-e1672167672568.jpg><p>After Bridget Hall left the picture, DiCaprio was rumored to have dated Claire Danes, who was his co-star in the 1996 Romeo and Juliet film, directed by Baz Luhrmann. The claims stemmed from the obvious fact that they shared chemistry on the set of the romance movie.</p><p>However, in 1996, it came to the fore that Leonardo was dating yet another model named <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kristen Zang</a>. He even took her to the premiere of Romeo and Juliet as his plus one. He dated the Michigan-born model for one year before their relationship came to an end in 1997.</p><h3><strong>Amber Valletta and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>The relationship between Amber Valletta and the Titanic actor began shortly after he gained widespread fame after starring in the iconic movie – Titanic. Like most women on this list, Amber is a model.</p><p>Now 49 years old, Amber Valletta is an American model who has dabbled into acting over the years. Her relationship with Leonardo started after the actor saw her in a magazine and had his workers track her down. Before Leonardo came into her life, Amber had already tried her first attempt at married life with her first husband, Hervé Le Bihan (m. 1994–1996). She later married Christian McCaw in 2003, and the marriage ended in 2015.</p><h3><strong>Helena Christensen and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>The relationship between Helena Christensen and Leonardo DiCaprio is described as a brief hookup. A former Victoria’s Secret Angel, Helena is a Danish model and photographer. She has been in a number of high-profile relationships with stars like INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, actor Norman Reedus, and Interpole singer Paul Banks. She has not been married before but shares a son with her ex, Norman Reedus, whom she dated for five years.</p><h3><strong>Naomi Campbell and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>The English supermodel was one of the brief flings Leonardo had, and their brief romance came after the actor became very popular. Reports have it that they dated briefly in 1995 and resorted to being just close friends. They have been spotted going out for lunch, yachting together, and having fun.</p><p>Born on May 22, 1970, Naomi Campbell, now 53 years old, has never been married. She became a first-time mom in 2021 through surrogacy. On his own part, Leonardo was rumored to have had an affair with Czech supermodel Eva Herzigová while she was married to Bon Jovi drummer Tico Torres.</p><h3><strong>Gisele Bündchen and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>The first longstanding relationship Leonardo ever had was with supermodel Gisele Bündchen. They met in 1999, but she gave him the red light as she was in a relationship with fellow model Scott Barnhill at the time. However, she broke up with Scott soon after, and Leonardo took a shot once again. This time, he won her heart.</p><p>The duo began dating in 2000, taking center stage as one of the most admired couples in Hollywood. Paparazzi were on the ground to take pictures of them wherever they went, and Leonardo graced the 2005 Oscar red carpet with Gisele. At a point during their relationship, the supermodel relocated to Los Angeles to be closer to Leonardo, but instead of strengthening their bond, the move backfired.</p><p>They broke up in 2002 and reconciled afterward. The last event they attended as a couple was the 2005 777th Academy Awards, where Leonardo scooped a nomination for Best Actor for his role in The Aviator. They broke up the same year with no reason for the split. However, Gisele’s later statements reveal they drifted apart. She realized their lifestyles no longer matched, and she wanted more.</p><p>Born July 20, 1980, Gisele Bündchen, now 43 years old, is now a mom of two, a son and a daughter, whom she had with her now former husband – NFL star Tom Brady. Their divorce was finalized on 28 October 2022.</p><h3><strong>Bar Refaeli and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>Though the records say they dated from 2005 to 2010, Bar Rafaeli and Leonardo DiCaprio’s relationship was on-again, off-again. The actor met the Israeli model, television host, and businesswoman at a U2 concert in Las Vegas. During the course of their relationship, they traveled around the world, and DiCaprio used this chance to meet Israeli President Shimon Peres and pay a visit to her hometown of Hod HaSharon with Leonardo’s mom.</p><p>Born on June 4, 1985, Bar was 20 years old, while Leonardo was 31 when they met and began dating. They broke up for good in 2010, and Rafaeli later got married to an Israeli-born businessman named Adi Ezra, with whom she shares three children – two daughters and a son. The reason given for Leonardo and Bar’s break up was that they grew apart.</p><h3><strong>Anne Vyalitsyna and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>During one of his breaks from his Israeli model girlfriend, Leonardo was said to have embarked on a fling with Russian-American model Anne Vyalitsyna. The two met in Ibiza and were pictured in cozy positions, but the affair didn’t last.</p><p>Born March 19, 1986, Anne is now a mom with her former fiance Adam Cahan. They got engaged on June 5, 2016, and got separated in 2018.</p><h3><strong>Blake Lively and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>Lively was Leonardo DiCaprio’s girl for just five months, but their romance was one to remember. They met on Steven Spielberg’s yacht in Monte Carlo during a trip to Europe for the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The two were subsequently pictured on romantic dates in different locations, including Venice and Los Angeles.</p><p>Born August 25, 1987, Blake Lively is now married to actor Ryan Reynolds, with whom she shares three children – James Reynolds, Betty Reynolds, and Inez Reynolds.</p><h3><strong>Erin Heatherton</strong></h3><p>The Victoria’s Secret model was Leonardo’s girlfriend for about ten months before they called things off between them. Their relationship lasted from December 2011 to November 2012, and their crazy schedules were blamed for tearing them apart. However, the split was peaceful, with no bad blood between them.</p><p>Born on March 4, 1989, Erin Heatherton is proof that Leonardo aims for younger women most of the time. Erin is now <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">engaged to an American-Polish trader Karol Kocemba</a>.</p><h3><strong>Toni Garrn</strong></h3><p>Toni Garn was added to DiCaprio’s long list of model girlfriends in 2013. Their first outing as a couple was at the 66th Cannes Film Festival in 2013, but their relationship ended in 2014.</p><p>Born on July 7, 1992, Toni Garrn is among the youngest women on DiCaprio’s dating list. Garrn is now married to actor Alex Pettyfer whom she got engaged to on 24 December 2019. Their first wedding took place on October 2, 2020, in Hamburg, Germany, while a second one followed on June 19, 2022, on the Island of Paros, Greece. They welcomed their first child, a daughter born in July 2021.</p><h3><strong>Kelly Rohrbach</strong></h3><p>The next model to grace Leonardo’s dating list is Kelly Rohrback, who is 16 years his junior. The Sports Illustrated model dated Leonardo DiCaprio in 2015, and the romance didn’t survive the year. Their tight schedules take the blame for the split. However, close sources say they parted on peaceful terms and are still friends.</p><p>Born on January 21, 1990, Kelly married attorney and Walton family heir Steuart Walton in 2019. The couple has welcomed their first child, a boy.</p><h3><strong>Nina Agdal</strong></h3><p>In true Leonardo DiCaprio style, the 16 years age gap between him and Nina Agdal did nothing to stop him from dating the Danish model. They dated in 2016 and were spotted at choice vacation spots in places like Montauk, New York., as well as the Bahamas.</p><p>They broke up in 2017, and nothing has been heard about the love life of Nina Brohus Agdal since then. Leonardo, on the other hand, has moved on to other women.</p><h3><strong>Camila Morrone and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>According to a close source, Leo has never loved any girl the way he loved Camila, and this is evident in the kind of relationship they had. The two sparked dating rumors for the first time in 2017. The rumors did not just turn out to be accurate, but Leonardo and his new catch served relationship goals to fans. They traveled to different American cities together, including Miami, Aspen, and Colorado. The former couple also left the shores of the United States to visit countries like Italy and France.</p><p>Their relationship lasted for about almost five years before news emerged in 2022 that they had called it off. During the course of their romance, DiCaprio and Morrone adopted three dogs. The dogs were all huskies which they brought home in 2020. They also spent months together at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was big news for people who are aware of Leo’s reputation for unsteady relationships.</p><p>News of their break up became certain when Leonardo began attending events without Camila, who would normally be by his side. He was seen at the Care Gala, Unicef Gala, and Saint Tropez alone. He also went on vacations without Camilla Morrone tagging along.</p><p>Interestingly, Leonardo was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reported to be planning to start a family with Camila</a>, something that has never been heard of in the history of Leonardo DiCaprio’s relationship timeline. Camila reportedly refused to put her career on hold to start a family with the Revenant actor. She chose to invest more time in her acting career than having babies.</p><p>Born on June 16, 1997, Camila Morrone is the youngest woman Leonardo has dated so far. With more than 20 years gap between him and Camila, it is obvious that the women keep getting younger for the actor. Despite the huge age gap, the former couple really bonded well and loved to spend time together. Sources close to them also suggested that Camila is Leonardo’s dream girl. She also bonded with his parents, especially his mom, who saw her as a daughter-in-law. Thus, there were high hopes that finally, the actor would settle down with Camila, but this was not to be.</p><h3><strong>Gigi Hadid and Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></h3><p>If you thought Leonardo DiCaprio was about to slow down in the dating market after losing his dream girl, you have to think again. The actor has already moved on from Camila the same year they broke up.</p><p>Gigi Hadid is reportedly the current girlfriend of Leonardo DiCaprio. The American model and television personality was romantically linked to Leonardo in September 2022 after they were photographed together in Paris. Though the latest addition to the list of Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriends took many by surprise, it has been welcomed with both arms by fans.</p><p>According to reports, Leonardo had always had his eyes on the model as he developed a soft spot for her before they began dating. They are still young in the relationship but seem to be into each other a lot. Hopes are high that the two will work something more permanent out. However, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">negative reports are already flying around</a>, with some sources saying Hadid is not serious about the relationship and only wants to focus on raising her daughter.</p><p>Born on April 23, 1995, Hadid has a child named Khai Hadid Malik with her ex Zayn Malik. The former couple welcomed their daughter on September 19, 2020. Gigi Hadid is a successful businesswoman who manages her own clothing line known as Guest In Residence. She joined the list of Top 50 Models ranking at Models.com in 2014, and two years later, in 2016, Hadid was named International Model of the Year by the British Fashion Council.</p><h2><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rumored Relationships</strong></h2><p>In addition to the women he was confirmed to have dated, Leonardo DiCaprio was also rumored to have hooked up with others.

Below are some of the ladies he was rumored to have dated briefly.</p><h3><strong>Claire Danes</strong></h3><p>Leonardo and Claire played the iconic roles of Romeo and Juliet in the 1996 adaptation of the film directed by Baz Luhrmann.

She is now with her longtime partner, a British sports and entertainment manager named David Gardner who she shares two children with. Live Tyler is also engaged to Gardner.</p><h3><strong>Eva Herzigová</strong></h3><p>A Czech-Italian supermodel and actress, Eva Herzigová was married to Tico Torres when it was rumored that she hooked up with Leonardo DiCaprio. They met at the premiere of his Man in the Iron Mask movie in 1998, and rumors made the round that they had a fling that lasted for two months.</p><p>She married the Bon Jovi drummer, Tico Torres, in 1996, but they divorced in June 1998. Eva has moved on to be with Italian businessman Gregorio Marsiaj with who she shares three sons. She is currently engaged to Marsiaj, and they live in Italy.</p><h3><strong>Virginie Ledoyen</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/489dd05a297a17d5736a8257cf75e12a-brittney-griner-wnba-1.jpg><p>Leonardo and Virginie Ledoyen played lovers on the set of The Beach in 2000, and they were on fire onscreen.

She has dated actor Arie Elmaleh with whom she has two children. She also has a daughter with production designer Louis Soubrier.</p><h2><strong>What is Leonardo DiCaprio’s Longest Relationship?</strong></h2><p>The actor’s longest relationship so far was with Camila Morrone, but he also dated Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen for about five years, with a break in-between.</p><p>Leonardo DiCaprio has dated many women, but his relationships are known to be short-lived. However, when Camila Morrone came into the picture, it seemed as though he had found the one. The former couple dated for more than four years after sparking dating rumors in 2017.</p><p>Considering how fast he moves on to the next relationship, many wonder what could have been so special about his romance with Camila that made it last longer than the others. Apparently, the two had known each other longer than we expected. They were friends before they began dating, and both get along with their various families. Also, Marrone’s mom, Lucila Sola, has romantic links with Al Pacino, who is Leonardo’s close friend and costar.</p><p>In regard to the long-lasting relationship Leonardo had with Gisele Bündchen, he met her in 1999, and they dated from 2000 to 2005. They met during one of her shows in 1999, and after several attempts to impress her, DiCaprio finally won her heart, and they began dating in 2005. The relationship hit a rough patch in 2002, which led to their split, but they came back together only to part for good in 2005.</p><h2><strong>Does Leonardo Dicaprio Have Kids?</strong></h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio is not just averse to marriage, he also doesn’t see himself having kids. This has been the case for the actor, who has been with several women in the past, but none of his past relationships has produced a child.</p><p>Even though there are rumors that he retracted his statement about not wanting to get married or have children, the Titanic actor is yet to father a child. The actor was also rumored to have adopted a baby from South Africa, but this is not the case. According to the claims, Leonardo flew to South Africa and fell in love with an orphan whom he adopted and brought to the United States to raise.</p><p>On the contrary, he didn’t adopt any child, but he actually committed to supporting an orphan financially and also keeping in touch with her for the rest of their lives. As the story goes, Leo was filming Black Diamond in Africa, and during this time, he spent a lot of time with the children at a Maputo, Mozambique, orphanage.</p><p>Some of the children also formed part of the extras in the movie, and this meant he spent more time with them. It was in the process of filming that he developed a bond with a little girl whom he reportedly sent monthly checks and also communicated with her through phone calls. However, no adoption took place, and DiCaprio is still without a child. The adoption he embarked on was when he adopted three Huskies with his girlfriend in 2020. The dogs were part of his relationship with Camila Morrone.</p><h3><strong>List of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Girlfriends So Far</strong></h3><ul><li>Bridget Hall</li><li>Kristen Zang</li><li>Amber Valletta</li><li>Helena Christensen</li><li>Naomi Campbell</li><li>Gisele Bündchen</li><li>Bar Refaeli</li><li>Anne Vyalitsyna</li><li>Blake Lively</li><li>Erin Heatherton</li><li>Toni Garrn</li><li>Kelly Rohrbach</li><li>Nina Agdal</li><li>Camila Morrone</li><li>Gigi Hadid</li></ul><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Leonardo DiCaprio Dating Now?</strong></h3><p>Leonardo DiCaprio is currently dating Vittoria Ceretti, a 25 year-old Italian model.
