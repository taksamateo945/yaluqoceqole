For the outing, Bush rocker Rossdale wore jean shorts, a white T-shirt, high-knee socks, and a bucket hat, while Stefani dressed in loose-fitting black attire with a red baseball cap.</p><p>While their middle son 6-year-old<strong> Zuma</strong>, tried out one particular attraction, the proud parents both took photos from their iPhones. Eldest brother <strong>Kingston</strong>, 9, patiently watched his younger sibling from the side. (The No Doubt songstress and Bush frontman also share a baby son <strong>Apollo</strong>, 17 months, although it remains unclear whether he was with the family on Sunday.)</p><p>Stefani, 45, and Rossdale, 49, <a href=#>confirmed to <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> on Aug. 3, that they were splitting after 13 years of marriage. “While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment,” they told Us. “To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>A source subsequently told <strong>Us</strong> that the parents of three <a href=#>were focusing on their kids</a>. “Of course Gwen is upset. She really gave it her all and tried to make it work as hard as she could for years,” one insider told<strong> Us</strong> at the time. “She was in love with him and they had the family she always dreamed of.”</p><p>Since their split announcement, Stefani has returned to work at The Voice, where she joins her fellow coach, <strong>Blake Shelton</strong>, who is also coping with life after <a href=#>his recent divorce from <strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a>. While Shelton “seems to have moved on from Miranda and is just over it,” an observer at a taping for the show last week told <strong>Us</strong> that the No Doubt frontwoman “seems sad.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6wnZ5iwLWxxZqlomWXlsOquoyrpqyrlJa5pnnRnqynoaSaeqKy056pZqugoba1ecOeq5qhnKh6c3yQbmhwcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
