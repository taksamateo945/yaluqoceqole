Cole is the current “it” guy of the Hip Hop sphere who manages to keep family affairs private. A recent&nbsp;<a href=#>iTunes</a> review revealed that the recording artist and his wife, Melissa Heholt, welcomed their daughter on Wednesday.</p><p>According to the review, “the two-part suite ‘She’s Mine’ may be the most important songs he’s written, as Cole hovers over his daughter and finds himself overcome by a strange feeling: hope.”</p><p>Needless to say that both media and fans were shocked to hear the news. “J. Cole married his gf, made a whole baby & album without the media knowing .. Dude is the true definition of ‘lowkey,'” noted one fan. R.J. Glosson of Houston, Texas tweeted, “J. Cole had a surprise album, a surprise marriage and now a surprise child. He’s going to go down as GOAT.”</p><p>J. Cole has been making waves in the music industry. His latest album, 4 Your Eyez Only, is highly anticipated by many and criticized by some. A few have accused J. Cole of using his lyrics to take shots at veteran rappers. J. Cole, however, remains focused on other things in life such as happiness and self-fulfillment.</p><p>“You’ll never have enough,” J. Cole said during an interview with <a href=#>NPR</a> in 2014. “You’ll never have enough success if success is what you seek,” he explained. “You’ll always be reaching. And I realize that if you’re trying to attain something that’s unattainable, you will never be happy. You will always be in a pattern of temporary happiness and satisfaction.”</p><p>4 Your Eyez Only makes its public debut on Friday. Check out the album’s trailer below!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kG9mampfZYVwtdJmoWabn6Gybq2Mp5ywZZSWsXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
