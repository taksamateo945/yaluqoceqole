Ahearne hit the headlines as a court heard that he was caught by police with shopping bags full of steroids and CS spray canisters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 59-year-old was a huge TV star as Warrior in the hit Saturday night&nbsp;show but fell from grace after he was jailed over a police corruption plot involving drug baron Curtis Warren and a detective chief inspector.</p><p
