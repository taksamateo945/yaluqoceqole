Christmas seems to have brought peace — temporarily, at least — to the Manzo/Laurita clan after years of feuds and fighting. On Christmas Eve, <strong><a href=#>Caroline Manzo</a></strong> took to Instagram to post an aerial shot of her large family sitting down to dinner together. Yes, that includes her formerly estranged younger sister <strong><a href=#>Dina Manzo</a></strong>!</p><p>“Merry, Merry, Christmas,” the former Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 53, captioned the photo, which featured Dina, 43, sitting at the same table as her sister-in-law <strong><a href=#>Jacqueline Laurita</a></strong> and brother <strong>Chris Laurita</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dina has been feuding with Caroline, Chris, 44, and Jacqueline, 44, for years, which was one of the reasons she initially exited RHONJ before returning last season after both ladies had left.&nbsp;</p><p>In November, Caroline appeared on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>, talking about Dina’s estrangement.&nbsp;</p><p>“Over the past four years, five years, Dina has never attended any family function at all. We've got nieces and nephews that are 3, 4, 5 years old, 9 months old, that she doesn't know," she said, going on to discuss Dina’s ultimatum to Chris, saying she told him he had to leave his wife Jacqueline. "I want you to understand the gravity of that: This is a man that has a son that has special needs, and you're saying for him to leave his wife in order for you to have a relationship with [him].”</p><p>Without directly addressing the feud during the holidays, Caroline made it clear that Dina was back in their lives. In addition to posting several images of family members, food, and decorations, she also Instagrammed a picture of a mug with a large “C” on it on Dec. 26.&nbsp;</p><p>“Hot toddy’s now a nightly ritual thanks @dinamanzo for making on Xmas Eve. Reminded me how much I love them,” Caroline captioned the photo.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqaqp%2Bhtq%2BxjJ2gp5ldoq6vxs5moZqboaqyrbXNnmSlmaWntrWtjK2moJ2knbKzecKhqaKrpKKutHnPopqsZWJlfnV%2BmGpp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
