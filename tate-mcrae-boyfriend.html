Additionally, she has a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers.</p><p>Tate McRae has quickly attained international notoriety in a very short period of time. Just at the age of 20, she has a huge fan following that keeps an eye on her. And recently, she has been the topic of discussion regarding her boyfriend. Is she dating anyone currently?</p><p>Previously, we discussed the <a href=#><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=#><strong>Shannon Sharpe</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ayo Edebiri</strong></a>.</p><h2>Tate McRae Is in a Relationship With Her Boyfriend, Cole Sillinger!</h2><p><strong>Tate McRae</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@tatemcrae</a>) has a boyfriend in 2023 whom she has been dating secretly since a few years ago. She has always been more interested in singing and dancing than in academics. She has always wanted to work as a singer and dancer in the entertainment sector, making herself a well-known celebrity. Despite being a well-known personality and having fans who adore and want to date her, she is quiet about her current relationship.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/09/tate-mcrae-boyfriend-2.jpg alt="Tate McRae and Cole Sillinger enjoying a vacation together. celebsindepth.com" width=720 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Tate McRae</span> and <span>Cole Sillinger enjoying a vacation together.<br></span></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Although she hasn't revealed anything publicly about her boyfriend, Tate McRae is in a relationship with <strong>Cole Sillinger </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@colesillinger</a>). The singer declared her relationship with ice hockey player Cole Sillinger on Instagram after her romance with <strong>Jonny Hader</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@johnyhader</a>) came to an end.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>On August 20, 2022, she shared pictures of them together enjoying a vacation on a boat and being cozy with one another. This post came as a revelation about their relationship. Fans were surprised and also happy regarding their relationship and soon commented on their <a href=# rel=noopener>post</a>, giving blessings and congratulating them. Other than that, there have been no posts of them together.</p><p>Rather than the post of them together without any caption, they have never acknowledged their dating life. Tate McRae is too young to commit to a lifelong relationship, so she might be avoiding the spotlight, especially her boyfriend. She might not want unnecessary attention regarding her relationship. Once celebrities get into a relationship, Paparazzi follows every step, which might be quite irritating as she cannot have privacy.</p><h2>Tate McRae and Her Boyfriend, Cole Sillinger’s Relationship Details!</h2><p>We are not sure how and when they met, but it looks like they have been a couple for a long time, and in 2022, <strong>Tate McRae</strong> made a decision to reveal it by sharing a post. But a thing that is running through every fan's head is that her current partner, <strong>Cole Sillinger</strong>, hasn't shared any of their posts together, leading fans to believe that he is not in love with her like she is.</p><p>Like his girlfriend, Cole Sillinger is a well-known figure. His father, longtime NHL player <strong>Mike Sillinger</strong>, played for 12 clubs and saw action in more than 1,000 games. Cole will likely play on the third line as he begins his third NHL season. <strong>Adam Fantilli</strong> and<strong> Boone Jenner</strong> will be in front of Sillinger, who is in the middle. With the Columbus Blue Jackets, Sillinger played in 79 games as a rookie and scored 31 points. Following that, he only managed 11 points in 64 games, failing to repeat his rookie season's performance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/09/tate-mcrae-boyfriend-1.jpg alt="Tate McRae and her boyfriend, Cole Sillinger, have been together since 2022. celebsindepth.com" width=1440 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Tate McRae</span> and her boyfriend, <span>Cole Sillinger, have been together since 2022.<br></span></strong><strong>Source: Pinterest</strong></p><p>Well, it's not necessary to post your partner to prove love.

The hockey player smiled and added;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>I'm shooting my shot, right?</strong></p><p>The singer later admitted that the ice hockey player got in touch with her after he confessed to having a crush on her in a video. She revealed:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Cole is best friends with the best buddy of my brother. Therefore, that was sort of the point of connection.
