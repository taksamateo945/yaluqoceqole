They’re all pretty amazing,” Lopez answered.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the former “In Living Color” dancer showed love to all of the women in the industry, she eventually identified popular country-pop singer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> as her “Woman of the Year.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Taylor’s pretty, you know, kind of killing it this year,” Lopez said. “Yeah, I would say Taylor maybe, yeah.”&nbsp;</p><p>Swift is fresh off a successful “Eras Tour, ” which sold out stadiums all over the globe. She also recently lit up movie theaters with her highly anticipated documentary film “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Lopez is right about the Pennsylvania native having <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an epic year</a>, many social media users felt her answer appeared to throw shade at the “Renaissance” singer, who also had one heck of a year herself.&nbsp;</p><p>One X handler suggested that Lopez was, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trying</a> so hard not to say Beyoncé.” A few others accused Lopez of humming the iconic riff from Beyoncé’s “Drunk In Love” performance in Dubai as she pondered over her answer.&nbsp;</p><p>“I do <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not</a> care about what Jlo says but its funny how she is humming the Dubai Drink in love riff (off key of course) while saying all of this,” said one person. Two others added, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">While</a> humming the drunk in love riff chile,” and “Sounded like someone else was all up in her mind.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sounded like someone else was all up in her mind</p>— nico (@Neekoleeto) <a href=#>December 8, 2023</a></figure><p>The third comment was a play on words referencing Yoncé’s one-year-old song, “All Up In Your Mind,” from her most recent album, “Renaissance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some comments also suggested that Beyoncé was the inspiration behind Lopez’s breastplate outfit for Elle’s event. “Your stylist disagrees,” one of the many tweets read.&nbsp;</p><p>The handler’s message was shared on The Neighborhood Talk’s Instagram page. The outlet also attached side-by-side photos of Lopez’s outfit next to the breastplate ensemble Beyoncé wore for the cover of her new single, “My House.”&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk)</a></p><p>This isn’t the first time hardcore Beyoncé fans got on the “I’m Real” vocalist for seemingly copying their favorite artist’s style. After performing at the 2020 American Music Awards, Lopez felt the wrath of the BeyHive for supposedly copying the aesthetic Bey used during her beloved “Drunk In Love” performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Both Grammy nominees rocked a wet-look bob hairstyle and a black cut-out bodysuit for their performances. Their set-up was also similar and featured shaded backgrounds with silhouette backdrops.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Bey may not be Lopez’s “Woman of the Year,” she’s managed to receive an array of praises from folks all over the world for the hard work she’s put into her six-month-long “Renaissance World Tour” and documentary film “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé.”&nbsp;</p><p>Though the movie just came out on Dec. 1, it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> already has managed to be the number-one movie in the country and received 100 percent on the critical film website Rotten Tomatoes.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmlwX5eyurvNnJysZZKaxqm11Z5ko52eo7ansdFmo6iola96uLvMmqVmp5ZiwamxjLKcmqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
