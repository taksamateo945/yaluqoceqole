The “Heartbeat Song” singer gave her two cents about vicious Internet trolls during The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Friday, April 3.</p><p>“I love that people think [the topic] is new. Like, welcome to the past 13 years,” Clarkson said of the criticism she’s received over the years. “I was the biggest girl on [American Idol] too. I wasn’t big, but people would call me big. I kind of always got that.” (This time around, Clarkson has been bashed for her post-baby body. She and husband <strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong> <a href=#>welcomed daughter </a><strong><a href=#>River Rose</a> </strong>in June 2014.)</p><p>Indeed, in March the 32-year-old entertainer silenced haters, one in particular, after calling her overweight. At the time, British <a href=#>TV personality <strong>Katie Hopkins</strong></a> was ruthless when she questioned if the singer had eaten “all of her backing singers.” Clarkson had the perfect response (“I’m awesome!”), but admitted to DeGeneres that she feels bad for others that have to listen to the nonsense.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Well it hurts your feelings more if it’s someone else that you like. I think what hurts my feelings for people is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl that’s bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, ‘Wow, if they think you’re big I must be so fat to them,'” Clarkson explained to DeGeneres. “And you’re just who you are. We are who we are. Whatever size. And it doesn’t mean that you’re gonna be that way forever.”</p><p>Clarkson got a resounding cheer from DeGeneres and the crowd, and didn’t apologize about her gorgeous, curvaceous figure for one second. (Nor should she!) “I yo-yo,” she said, joking: “Sometimes I’m more fit and I get into kickboxing and hardcore, and then sometimes I don’t and go, ‘Nope, I’d rather have wine!'”</p><p>Watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKepJyueqS4wKuirKeeYsCprcqeqmanlpt6uLHIoJ%2BtZZOntrW1wqKqpmWZmXqzrdOhnKtlmJbDpnnWoqWeZWJlfnZ%2Fkw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
