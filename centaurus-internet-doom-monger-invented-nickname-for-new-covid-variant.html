Its new name is Centaurs strain. Get used to it. Today, I’m in command of anything pandemic.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He later claimed the strain’s ‘high transmission rate, systemic damage and immunity depletion’ would cause a new wave of deaths across the globe.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Ostale, who claims ‘Earthlings need a radical social revolution’ in his Twitter bio, wrote: ‘What I called many months ago, the Great Period.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The name Centaurus comes from&nbsp;a constellation featuring Alpha Centauri — the closest star to Earth that is 349 light years away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But experts were quick to dismiss his nickname for the strain, arguing people should stick to the official name BA.2.75 when referring to it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, Tweeted: ‘Stop trying to make Centaurus happen.
