Likewise, during her school days at the age of 12, she was extremely targeted for bullying. However, she has overcome her personality development.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Reflecting on Suede Brooks’s professional life, she started her social media career from a very young age. As she has been interested in social media, she first created her Tumblr account where she gained fame through beachbikiniklass account. Then in 2013, she created her Youtube channel and posted her first video “WHISPER CHALLENGE” on Jul 13, 2014, along with her friends. She mainly focuses on fashion tips and make-up tutorials on her channel.</p><p>Nonetheless, she is close to the glamour world from a very young age as she did her first ad campaign when she was just eight, for the renowned clothing-retail company, H&M at the age of eight.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16861 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Suede-Brooks-career.jpg alt="Suede Brooks" width=650 height=354 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-16861 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Suede Brooks captured along with her siblings during Youtube video shoot (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Likewise, one of her popular videos is How I Style My Short Hair! // Quick Hairstyles for Summer with 1.1M views. Some of the notable videos are My Bikini Collection | (TRY-ON), YES! Im 14 || The Stripped Down Challenge, A More Serious Note… W/ Tana Mongeau | Suede Brooks, HOW TO TRAIN LIKE A MODEL, My Everyday Makeup Routine | Suede Brooks and many more.</p><p>Currently, she is concentrating on her modeling career with full energy. She has been featured by ‘No Ties Management’. Due to her busy schedule, she hasn’t been really doing YouTube for the past two months. As she doesn’t want herself to be known as ‘that 14-year-old YouTuber who blew up’, she won’t want to leave her followers behind. She is focused, considerate and smart for her dream to be a supermodel and be successful in the future.</p><h4>More details</h4><p>Her parents have played a pro-active role in shaping Suede’s career. Her brother, Blaze, is a graphic designer, and her sister, India, is an avid blogger. Thanks to her Tumblr blog and YouTube channel, most of Suede Brooks’ fans are familiar with her vivacious if not a little bawdy personality. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that her personal life has been a subject of intense and constant speculation.</p><p>Rumour mills were set abuzz in March 2016, when Brooks was spotted with 1D’s Niall Horan in LA. Needless to say, quite a few 1D fans were upset by the news, and they took to social media to vent their displeasure on Horan’s “alleged girlfriend”.&nbsp;Finding herself at the receiving end of yet another spate of bullying, Brooks wasn’t amused. She took to Twitter to express her exasperation at the baseless speculations surrounding her personal life and quickly dispelled the myth that she was seeing Horan.</p><p>Though the hullabaloo has died down, it’s a scourge she will have to learn to deal with or better still, turn a deaf ear t, in her journey forward – as the clichéd but true words go, fame comes at a price. Though her rise from being a popular vlogger to a promising model is a relatively new development, Suede Brooks is no stranger to the world of glitz and glamour.</p><h4>Beyond Youtube</h4><p>In fact, she did her first ad campaign when she was just eight, for the renowned clothing-retail company, H&M. While most of her peers were into sports or cheerleading, Brooks was always fascinated by the fashion world. And while most people are forced to give up on their childhood dreams, Brooks had the good luck to have the courage of her convictions and ample opportunities to justify them.</p><p>Given the way her modeling career is shaping up, it’s certainly not a far-fetched dream that she wants to create her own clothing line. She is also hoping to call it ‘Suede’. She defines her unique sense of style as edgy, chic, and girly. Any guesses as to what the one item in her wardrobe is that she cannot live without?</p><p>She has recently extended into music and vlogging as well. Similarly, she even contained spreading her message of positivity through her anti-bullying activism. She aims to encourage service both on and offline. Further, she has worked with brands including Adidas, Sephora, Marc Jacobs, and Lexus, and more featured in the publications like Teen Vogue.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>Young and talented Suede Brooks has earned a decent sum of money through her Youtube career as she gains good fortune from her makeup tutorial and tricks, beauty tips, product reviews, and travel vlogs.
