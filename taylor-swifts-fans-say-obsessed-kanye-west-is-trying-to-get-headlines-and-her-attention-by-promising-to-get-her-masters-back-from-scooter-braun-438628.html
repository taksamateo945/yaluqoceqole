Kim Kardashian’s husband supposedly wants to help his old nemesis get back her masters from <a href=# title="Taylor Swift Reportedly Determined To ‘Make A Statement’ About Her Career And The Scooter Braun Drama While Performing At The AMAs!&nbsp;">Scooter Braun</a>, his former manager.</p><p>The father of four and business mogul tweeted Friday: “I’M GOING TO PERSONALLY SEE TO IT THAT <a href=# title="Justin Bieber Comes To Scooter Braun’s Defense After Taylor Swift Calls Him Out!">TAYLOR SWIFT</a> GETS HER MASTERS BACK. SCOOTER IS A CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1307051810037927937</p><p>Earlier this year, Swift said the following after her former label released a live album, Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008, she had recorded when she was just 18 years old: “It looks to me like Scooter Braun and his financial backers, 23 Capital, Alex Soros, and the Soros family and the Carlyle Group have seen the latest balance sheets and realized that paying $330 MILLION for my music wasn’t exactly a wise choice and they need money,” Swift said of the Big Machine Label Group release. “Just another case of shameless greed in the time of Coronavirus. So tasteless, but very transparent.”</p><p>Music fans are not sure what to think of West’s latest move. One of them stated: “I do t think she needs help. She’s a capable woman. Kanye, irrespective of his mental health issues, consistently shows sexist behavior. Just stop.”</p><p>This person chimed in: “LOL, he can help by keeping the hell away from here. Go get some help if Kim wants to help her husband get him to help quietly out if the public eye and stop having cameras everywhere. The man obviously feels the pressure. I’m no fan of his at all but still, see his struggles.”</p><p>A third commenter tried to be optimistic about this situation and said: “Maybe he’s trying to fix a relationship with a peer that he feels guilty about and y’all are shitting on him so much you can’t see the good in this gesture.”</p><p>This critic explained: “He peed on a Grammy. I swear to Goodness he needs to go outside & eat a bucket of fuc8k.”</p><p>Another social media user added: “WHEN he’s not in the spotlight he brings up Taylor who can hold her, You go girl.”</p><p>This Instagrammer thinks the rapper should move on with his life and leave Swift alone once and for all: “Why is he so obsessed w her? It’s very, very puzzling.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Swift is just a small part of West’s recent activity on Twitter.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklsatu9FmqrChlqnAbrLAp6pmq5GuerCu0p6qrJ2UYriiutieZLCdo6l6qr%2BMramyoZ6cerW7jKCcrWWYmq6luMinnKxlkaOxbrTEq2SarKSau7W1zqdkm7Fdpb%2BwucisoKefXam8brPErWShnaJiuqK%2F056prGWSlrCsecWrpqZlo5i8sMDEq2SbqpGqu26AknFta3Bf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
