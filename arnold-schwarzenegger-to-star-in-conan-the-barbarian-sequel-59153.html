According to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, Arnold additionally confirmed in the clip that he and Maria have yet to finalize their divorce.</p><p>Earlier this week, a source close to the couple told <a href=#>TMZ</a> that “Maria would like their divorce to become final, but Arnold is not taking the necessary steps to end the marriage.” In July 2016, <a href=#>TMZ</a> similarly reported that “neither is interested in ending the marriage. It just goes on, as they lead separate lives.” Though Arnold and Maria, 61, have not publicly revealed why they’ve continued to stay legally married despite their 2011 separation, sources have noted it may be because Maria is “super religious” and does not believe in divorce.</p><p>Arnold and Maria — who tied the knot in 1986 — announced their split following his public admission to <a href=#>fathering a child</a> with a member of their household staff, Mildred Patricia Baena. Today, Arnold is close with his 20-year-old <a href=#>son with Mildred, Joseph Baena</a>, and the two recently celebrated the actor’s birthday together. The Terminator star and Maria are parents to four children: <a href=#>Katherine Schwarzenegger</a>, 27, Christina Schwarzenegger, 26, Patrick Schwarzenegger, 24, and Christopher Schwarzenegger, 20.</p><p>During a recent exclusive interview with <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a>, the eldest Schwarzenegger child, Katherine, revealed her parents still <a href=#>spend every holiday together</a> with their kids. “We’ll have a full family Thanksgiving dinner at my mom’s house. We all sleep [there] and then we go on bike rides and hang out together as a family,” she said in November 2016. “Then for Christmas, we’ll be all together in LA. We’re always together on Christmas; my mom, my dad, my siblings. We’re all together as a whole family. It’s really nice.”</p><p>So, why are Arnold and Maria still holding on to their marriage six years after their separation? According to Maria’s brother, Anthony Shriver, the journalist is <a href=#>simply “doing good”</a> with their current situation. “She’s got four wonderful kids… They consume a lot of her time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8CrpaiklGLApLTWmqmznZ6atKix0WarqGWjqa6zecinZJynnpa7bsDHnmSbmaKXrrO1wKdkrJ2hqrKteZRyaG5r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
