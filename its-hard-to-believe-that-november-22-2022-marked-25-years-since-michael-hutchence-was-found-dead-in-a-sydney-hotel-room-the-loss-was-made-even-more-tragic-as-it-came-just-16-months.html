Despite the 35-year age difference between them, they are bonded through their unimaginable shared grief.</span></p><p><span>That same year, Tiger took a trip with her then fianc</span><span>é, Aussie musician Nick Allbrook, to Hastings in the United Kingdom. Sources say they spent “lovely, cosy time with Catherine’s eclectic group of friends, listening to music and admiring each other’s art”.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p>Getty</p><p><span>Catherine has also spoken on her Instagram of listening to one of aspiring singer Tiger’s songs, ‘Teena’.</span></p><p><span>“Catherine thinks the world of Tiger and is so proud of the woman she’s become. She has no doubt her parents would be too,”&nbsp;a source shared with New Idea at the time.</span></p><p><span>“Tiger admires Catherine’s incredible work as a writer and women’s rights activist. They are kindred spirits through shared losses, experience and creativity.”</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p>Instagram</p><p>In February 2023, Tiger Lily followed in her father’s footsteps and released her debut album titled Tragic Tiger’s Sad Meltdown.&nbsp;</p><p>Just three months later, she revealed she and Nick had sadly split after more than six years together.</p><p>But in June of that same year, she debuted a new romance with British model Ben Archer who took to his Instagram account to share rare photos of his famous girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with our sister publication <span>Woman’s Day</span>, an insider source said the couple was the real deal.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ben’s completely disarmed her and for the first time she can see a future of weddings, babies, and something she’s never really had – a family,” they said.</p><p>“He’s swept her off her feet. He’s everything she wants in a man and he makes her so happy. He’s skimmed around the industry for years and has ambitions of making music videos and documentaries, but he adores her ‘whatever’ attitude to fame.”</p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p>Instagram</p><p>These days, the stunning only daughter of Paula and Michael reportedly lives in Western Australia, her late father’s home state.</p><p>It is unclear when she moved back to her native Australia after being raised in the United Kingdom by her adoptive father Bob Geldof.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her famous family relations, it’s clear that Tiger Lily is eager to stay out of the spotlight, with new images and public sightings few and far between.&nbsp;</p><p>She does have a private Instagram account, but we can assume she only allows her close friends and family to follow it.</p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p>Instagram</p><p>Sadly, despite being the only child of Hutchence, Tiger Lily has missed out on millions of dollars in royalties from her father’s musical career due to mismanagement of funds.</p><p>Like much of her life, what she does for work is also a mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>See more photos of Tiger Lily <span>here</span>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5mpwG60wKubZqyfYq%2BmuMierZ5lpJ2utXnNqK2epZKav25%2BkWZpaWpiYrqivsqem2ZqZWLGpq3RrGSsoZ6Ysm65yJyfmp2cYrW2wMKhnKeblWLEor%2BMn6auppRisaatw2agp2WRYsC6sM2esGagn6myrXnRqKamZaSdsm64zqyqZq%2BRqHqurcOeZJ6ulaN6rrvRnmStqpGctqR5wKxkoqxdmK6usYyjrKysXWaDbrnOp6uhq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
