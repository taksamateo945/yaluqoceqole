Among the directors who have made their <strong>Star Wars</strong> debuts in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mandalorian</a></strong> are Rick Famuyiwa, Deborah Chow, Peyton Reed, Robert Rodriguez, Taika Waititi, and Carl Weathers. In fact, the flagship <strong>Star Wars</strong> series has become an excellent jumping on point for many of these directors to then go on to helm their own adventures set in the galaxy far, far away. Rodriguez executive produced and directed several episodes of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Book of Boba Fett</a></strong>, Chow has directed all six episodes of the upcoming <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a></strong> limited series, and Waititi will next tackle his own <strong>Star Wars</strong> movie once work on <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor: Love and Thunder</a></strong> is complete.</p><p>And then there’s Bryce Dallas Howard, who has quickly turned heads with her directorial work on <strong>The Mandalorian </strong>and <strong>The Book of Boba Fett</strong>. It’s no exaggeration to say that since her debut in 2019, Howard has directed three of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most well-received</a>, memorable, and exciting <strong>Star Wars</strong> stories of the Disney era. From an episode of <strong>The Mandalorian</strong> that celebrates the films of Akira Kurosawa (a major influence on <strong>Star Wars</strong>) to her more recent dive into Mandalorian and Jedi lore on <strong>The Book of Boba Fett</strong>, Howard has shown she has a deep understanding of this galaxy’s signature blend of action, fantasy, mythology, and pastiche, with a few fun easter eggs thrown in to boot.</p><p>This is why there are many fans now petitioning for Disney to give Howard a shot at a <strong>Star Wars</strong> film. It certainly would be the logical next step for a fan-favorite director (and movie star) who’s proved herself behind the camera and is a life-long fan of this universe. So when <strong>Den of Geek</strong> sat down with Howard to chat about the upcoming <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic World: Dominion</a></strong>, we had to take a quick detour to ask how she felt about the possibility of directing a <strong>Star Wars </strong>movie one day.</p><p>“Oh, my goodness. Well, you know, I absolutely love directing. And I hope to be able to direct many, many features in my future. That would be absolutely wonderful,” Howard tells <strong>Den of Geek</strong>. “And I have to say, just getting to work in the <strong>Star Wars</strong> universe, especially being led by [executive producers] Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, has been one of the greatest joys of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOm6mym5VisaK4y5qqZqCfrK6zsIyop56mo2LCsXnAm6aurF2ZtrOxwq2gp59dlnq0wMCrZLCZoqh6rrvVopxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
