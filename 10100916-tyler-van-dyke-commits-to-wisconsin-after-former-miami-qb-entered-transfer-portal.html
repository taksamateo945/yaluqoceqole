He went just 15-13 as the starter, however, and lost his spot atop the depth chart to freshman Emory Williams ahead of the Florida State game after a turnover-riddled 2023 season.</p><p>He then regained his starting berth when Williams broke his left forearm in the loss to Florida State. But with Williams likely to have the inside track on the starting gig next season, given Van Dyke's struggles, a change of scenery made sense.</p><p>Wisconsin was a logical landing spot, given the huge need at quarterback. Tanner Mordecai used up his eligibility, Braedyn Locke has just three starts to his name and the Badgers have an inexperienced quarterback room (Nick Evers, Cole LaCrue and incoming freshman Mabrey Mettauer) beyond that.</p>Jake Maier <span class=acct>@JakeJMaier</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyler Van Dyke's experience will be valuable for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Badgers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Badgers&lt;/a> as they navigate a tough 2024 season.&lt;br>&lt;br>With matchups against Alabama, USC, Penn State, and Oregon coming up, bringing in a QB with 32 total games of experience with 28 starts against solid completion is a plus.</p><p>Van Dyke will have pole position in the team's quarterback competition this spring, in other words.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>Jesse Temple</a> of The Athletic noted, however, Van Dyke "is not a mobile threat, as many of offensive coordinator Phil Longo's quarterbacks have been. So it will be interesting to see how the offense is tailored toward his skill set."</p>J.D. PicKell <span class=acct>@jdpickell</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyler Van Dyke to Wisconsin (on paper) is a great fit. Lots of talk about his turnovers but very little about his 3 different OCs. Getting back into a style of offense that made him rookie of the year in the ACC&lt;br>&lt;br>Full thoughts: &lt;a href="https://t.co/1OKVBrth8S">https://t.co/1OKVBrth8S&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/0IZICCkEjZ">pic.twitter.com/0IZICCkEjZ&lt;/a></p>Jacob Wayne <span class=acct>@wayne_sports_</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Neither Tyler Van Dyke or Wisconsin lived up to the hype this season but I think TVD in Longo's offense has a lot of potential. Just need to get some WR depth with Dike and Bell hitting the portal.</p><p>He's also had a lot of instability in his college career, with three different offensive coordinators at Miami. As The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Manny Navarro</a> noted, Van Dyke thrived under Rhett Lashlee's up-tempo system in 2021, throwing for 2,203 yards, 20 touchdowns and three interceptions in the final six games while completing 65.5 percent of his passes.</p>Tom Fornelli <span class=acct>@TomFornelli</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I firmly believe the Tyler Van Dyke I saw in 2021 is still in there somewhere. We'll see if Phil Longo and the Badgers can bring it out of him.</p><p>Miami went 5-1 during that stretch and it appeared as though Van Dyke was a star-in-the-making. That didn't come to fruition in the two seasons that followed, though perhaps he'll maximize his ability in Madison.</p><p>"He can be two different people," an ACC head coach told <a href=# rel=noopener>Max Olson and Bruce Feldman</a> of The Athletic. "He's got a lot of arm talent. I think he played hurt this year and he was wildly inconsistent. Maybe he just needs a refresh."</p><p>Now he's getting one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGWGcoKMrbClnaJiw6K6jJ2wpJ1dmLyuucitqmasn2LEqr%2FCqKWsoZ5irqfAxKtkn6eiorKzecyimKahXaavbrHNrZyrnZRiwbOtzaydnqpdpbyzwMCl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
